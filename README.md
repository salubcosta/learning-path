# Learning Path

This repository is my personal space to study and practice programming languages.

The main goals are:
- ⚙️ Learn and practice programming concepts
- 📚 Keep everything organized for future reference
- 🔨 Build a portfolio to showcase my learning journey

## Notes

1. Some notes may be in **Portuguese**, as this repository is also a personal study log.
2. This repository is still a work in progress, therefore the README will be updated later.
